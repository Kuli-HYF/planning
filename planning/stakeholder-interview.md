## 1. First Interview

- How do you see/understand the badges system?

- What is its main purpose (the badges)?

- How did you come up with the idea(badges)?

- Which criteria would you use to grant these badges to companies?

- What kind of benefit do companies get from engaging in the project?

- What kind of benefit do women and under represented groups get from engaging in the project?

- What's your target demographic?

- How to collect the information from companies? Can we propose some kind of exchange (surveys => feedback in association with HR professional in exchange for the info)?

### Notes

#### Possible criteria to assess companies' performance and grant badges

- Childcare

Depending on the response to question about collecting information it's necessary to decide about using fake companies to create the model object or making gathering the information part of the project.
