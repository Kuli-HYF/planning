## the Kuli logo and brand:

- The Kuli brand represents equality, human connection and friendship.
- The logo is made of modest, rounded and friendly forms.
- Our main colors have a "male" (blue) and "female" (pink) component. In current times these colors may have a gender specific connotation, but this hasn't always been the case. In our brand these colors represent balance and complementary qualities.
- The main form or feature of the logo is where the 'u' connects to a complementary colored form representing a link or connected symbol. 
- The 'u' is skewed and dropped below the font baseline to represent people 'outside of the box' and the complementary color shaped form together create a symbol of a link, a connection, or a hand lifting this 'u' back into the shape of the logo.
- It is in this shape, this complementary form that Kuli has it's purpose.
