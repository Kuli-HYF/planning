## Internal: Involuntary

<!--  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over. they may include:  - each of your individual skill levels  - amount of time available to work on the project-->

- We will use mainly HTML, CSS, JS, React, Strapi, Figma and Heroku.

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:  - coding style & conventions  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository  - the number of hours you want to spend working  - only using the colors black and white-->

- Design first for mobile and then scale.

- We will stick to the format, linting and all checks established.

- Every PR should be reviewed and approved by at least 1 team member.
