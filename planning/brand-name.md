### Just a small topic about the name 'Kuli'

From Rayane (co-creator of the Kuli concept):

> The idea of the name 'Kuli' came from Alexander. It means closer friend, solid relationship in sumerian, one of the oldest languages in the world.
Sumer is now southern Iraq, from around Baghdad to the Persian Gulf.
We didn't want to use an English word. Our idea was to pick a name that means human connection, relationship.
