## Notes and key points

### D

D. is a woman who comes from the middle east and currently lives in Belgium. Her mother tongue is Arabic but she speaks English and is also in the process of learning Dutch. She is 39 years old and recently became a mother. She has a master degree in Data Science and worked as a university professor in her country, Jordan, before moving.

She has faced different sets of challenges during her time as a student and as a worker in her country, but also in Belgium as an immigrant and most recently as a mother.

**Some of the biggest challenges in her country have been:**

- Safety outside the workplace: this is a factor for companies to consider hiring women since companies don't think is safe for women to work late while this is an implicit requirement.

- STEM fields are considered for men. This results in families where expectations over women are related to other fields or occupations.

- Some of the IT courses available were considered "too physical" for women.

**Some of the biggest challenges in Belgium have been:**

- Not speaking Dutch fluently.

- Recognition of her diplomas before the Belgian institutions. Difficulty navigating the system and overall bureaucracy.

- Feeling excluded based on her religious background and appearance.

#### Motivations / desires

- For her, the ideal company to work for would be one **not to far from home**, where **English is enough to play a role** and where **diversity and religious openness** is an important part of the environment. **Diversity** seems to her more important than having a "women-centered" working culture.

- Two things that would help a lot when working: **accessible daycare** and **flexible hours**.
