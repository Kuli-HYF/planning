## Notes and key points

### D

D. is a woman who comes from the middle east and currently lives in Belgium. Her mother tongue is Arabic but she speaks English and is also in the process of learning Dutch. She is 39 years old and recently became a mother. She has a master degree in Data Science and worked as a university professor in her country, Jordan, before moving.

She has faced different sets of challenges during her time as a student and as a worker in her country, but also in Belgium as an immigrant and most recently as a mother.

**Some of the biggest challenges in her country have been:**

- Safety outside the workplace: this is a factor for companies to consider hiring women since companies don't think is safe for women to work late while this is an implicit requirement.

- STEM fields are considered for men. This results in families where expectations over women are related to other fields or occupations.

- Some of the IT courses available were considered "too physical" for women.

**Some of the biggest challenges in Belgium have been:**

- Not speaking Dutch fluently.

- Recognition of her diplomas before the Belgian institutions. Difficulty navigating the system and overall bureaucracy.

- Feeling excluded based on her religious background and appearance.

#### Motivations / desires

- For her, the ideal company to work for would be one **not to far from home**, where **English is enough to play a role** and where **diversity and religious openness** is an important part of the environment. **Diversity** seems to her more important than having a "women-centered" working culture.

- Two things that would help a lot when working: **accessible daycare** and **flexible hours**.

### M

M is 23 and is Belgian. She graduated from university not long ago and is currently in her first job in an IT company. M. studied Engineering and Technology with emphasis on Electronics and ICT. Dutch is her mother tongue. She also speaks fluent English. She has been into STEM topics since she was in highschool. First physics and math and then ICT and engineering.

**Problems and challenges:**

- In her experience, **being exposed to technology from a young age** is probably the biggest factor that impacts the participation of women in the IT world.

- From her experience studying with people from other countries, she thinks **language plays a big part in being able to find a job**. Some of her classmates from university struggled to find a job because of this, despite having a certificate from a Belgian institution and technical knowledge.

- Also **applying for jobs and navigating the labour market** can be challenging for foreigners.

### G

G comes from Ethiopia. She has been living in Belgium for 5 years now and is currently working for a project helping people learn web development. She has a Bachelor's degree in administration and has been learning web development and programming since arriving in Belgium. In her experience, access to ICT programs can be difficult for women since is not encourage for young students.

**Problems and challenges:**

- Speaking the language fluently has been a major challenge in order to get a job. Going into IT and development has helped get around this situation.

- Getting the proper education/instruction without having to pay high tuition fees.

- Feeling a bit intimidated in man-controlled environment.

#### Motivations /desires

- Finding job opportunities to grow in the IT sector while having the opportunity to work from home and having a flexible schedule.
